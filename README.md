# Dilation-Erosion-CV
Python implementation for the dilation and erosion operations in computer vision using numpy and openCV libraries.

# dilation.py
Contains the function that implements the dilation operation.

# erosion.py
contains the function that implements the erosion operation.

# Index.py
Imports the dilation and erosion functions and reads the image from the "images" folder and using openCV ".cvtColor" method converts the image to a gray scale image using which we create a binary image for the subsequent operations for erosion and dilation.

# read.py
Simply contains a line that using the "imread" method of the openCV reads the image to be used for the erosion and the dilation.
